- Configured Tailwind CSS with Vite plugin approach
- Set up TypeScript and ESLint configuration
- Established development environment with hot reload
- **Result**: Working development environment with build pipeline

#### **Step 2: Basic Component Structure**
- Created core Vue components:
  - `GameBoard.vue` - 3x3 grid layout with cell interactions
  - `GameCell.vue` - Individual cell component with styling
  - `GameStatus.vue` - Game status display and controls
  - `DifficultySelector.vue` - AI settings and game mode selection
- **Challenge Overcome**: Resolved Tailwind CSS v4 compatibility issues with `@apply` directives
- **Result**: Complete component architecture with proper TypeScript interfaces

#### **Step 3: Game State Management with Composables**
- Implemented reactive state management using Vue 3 composables:
  - `useGameState.ts` - Core game logic and board state
  - `useGameMode.ts` - Game mode management (Human vs Human/AI)
  - `useGame.ts` - Main controller combining all state management
- **Features**: Move validation, winner detection, game statistics
- **Result**: Fully reactive game state with type-safe composables

#### **Step 4: Core Game Logic Implementation**
- Built comprehensive game utilities:

- **Result**: Robust game logic foundation with debugging capabilities

#### **Step 5: AI Players Implementation**
- Created complete AI system with three difficulty levels:
  - `easyAI.ts` - 80% win detection, 70% block detection (~30% win rate)
  - `mediumAI.ts` - Perfect win/block, fork detection (~70% win rate)
  - `hardAI.ts` - Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning (~95% win rate)
  - `aiManager.ts` - AI factory and coordinator
- **Technical Achievement**: Perfect minimax implementation that never loses
- **Result**: Complete AI system with realistic thinking delays

#### **Step 6: Enhanced UI/UX Features**
- Implemented modern visual design:
  - CSS animations for cell interactions and winning states
  - Gradient backgrounds and hover effects
  - Responsive design for all screen sizes
  - Visual feedback for game states

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Challenges Overcome

### **1. Tailwind CSS v4 Compatibility**
**Challenge**: `@apply` directives and `space-y` utilities not working with new Tailwind version
**Solution**: Migrated to inline utility classes and removed all `@apply` usage
**Learning**: Always check framework compatibility when using latest versions

### **2. ESLint Variable Detection in Vue Templates**
**Challenge**: ESLint not recognizing template variable usage, causing false positives
**Solution**: Renamed variables to be more explicit and added targeted ESLint disable comments
**Learning**: Vue 3 template analysis requires careful variable naming

### **3. Component Architecture Design**
**Challenge**: Balancing component reusability with game-specific functionality
**Solution**: Used composable pattern for state management with focused components
**Learning**: Composables provide excellent separation of concerns in Vue 3

### **4. AI Algorithm Performance**
**Challenge**: Minimax algorithm potentially causing UI freezing
**Solution**: Optimized with alpha-beta pruning and realistic thinking delays
**Learning**: User experience requires balancing algorithm complexity with responsiveness
