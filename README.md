## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Choose your game mode**: Human vs Human or Human vs AI
2. **Select AI difficulty** (if playing against AI): Easy, Medium, or Hard
3. **Choose AI player** (if playing against AI): X or O
4. **Make your move**: Click on any empty cell
5. **Win the game**: Get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)

### Game Rules
- Players alternate turns (X goes first)
- First player to get three in a row wins
- If all cells are filled without a winner, it's a tie
- Use the "New Game" button to restart
- Use "Undo" to take back your last move

## 🤖 AI Implementation Details

### Easy AI
- 80% chance to detect and make winning moves
- 70% chance to block obvious opponent wins
- Random move selection for remaining scenarios
- Provides a casual gaming experience

### Medium AI
- Perfect win and block detection
- Fork creation and blocking capabilities
- Strategic positioning (corners, center, sides)
- Challenging but beatable for experienced players

### Hard AI
- Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- Perfect play - never makes suboptimal moves
- Evaluates all possible game outcomes
- Impossible to beat with optimal play
