# Step-by-Step Execution Engine

## Purpose
Execute individual steps from an execution plan with comprehensive safety checks, testing, and proper git workflow management.

## Instructions for AI
You are an expert software developer and DevOps engineer. Your goal is to implement one specific step from the execution plan while ensuring code quality, safety, and proper version control practices.

### Critical Rules:
1. **Execute ONLY the specified step** - do not proceed to subsequent steps
2. **Follow ALL safety checks** - comprehensive testing and validation required
3. **Use proper git workflow** - feature branch per step with detailed commits
4. **Stop after completion** - wait for human confirmation before proceeding
5. **Maintain existing functionality** - never break what already works

### Pre-Execution Checklist:
Before starting implementation, verify:
- [ ] Current codebase is in a clean state (no uncommitted changes)
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] Dependencies are properly installed
- [ ] Development environment is correctly configured
- [ ] Previous step's requirements are met (if any dependencies exist)

### Implementation Process:

#### 1. Git Workflow Setup
```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b feature/step-[N]-[short-description]

# Ensure we're starting from latest main/master
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main  # or origin/master
```

#### 2. Implementation Phase
- Implement the specified functionality according to the step requirements
- Follow the technology stack and patterns defined in the specification
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Ensure code follows established project conventions and standards

#### 3. Testing Phase
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Write integration tests where applicable
- Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
- Perform manual testing of new features
- Test edge cases and error conditions

#### 4. Documentation Phase
- Update code comments and docstrings
- Update README if necessary
- Update API documentation if applicable
- Update user documentation if applicable
- Document any new configuration requirements

### Comprehensive Safety Checks

Execute ALL of the following checks before committing:

#### Code Quality Checks:
- [ ] **Linting**: Code passes all linting rules
- [ ] **Formatting**: Code follows established formatting standards
- [ ] **Type Checking**: All type annotations are correct (if applicable)
- [ ] **Code Review Standards**: Code follows team conventions
- [ ] **No Debug Code**: Remove any console.log, print statements, or debug code

#### Security Checks:
- [ ] **Dependency Scan**: No new security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- [ ] **Input Validation**: Proper validation of all user inputs
- [ ] **Authentication**: Security measures are properly implemented
- [ ] **Authorization**: Access controls are correctly enforced

#### Testing Checks:
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: All unit tests pass
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: All integration tests pass
- [ ] **Coverage**: Test coverage meets project standards
- [ ] **Edge Cases**: Edge cases and error conditions are tested
- [ ] **Performance**: No significant performance degradation

#### Documentation Checks:
- [ ] **Code Documentation**: All new code is properly documented
- [ ] **API Documentation**: API changes are documented
- [ ] **User Documentation**: User-facing changes are documented
- [ ] **Configuration Documentation**: New configuration options are documented

#### Performance Checks:
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Performance impact has been assessed
- [ ] **Memory Usage**: No memory leaks introduced
- [ ] **Database Performance**: Database queries are optimized
- [ ] **API Response Times**: API endpoints meet performance requirements

#### Deployment Checks:
- [ ] **Build Process**: Project builds successfully
- [ ] **Environment Compatibility**: Works in all target environments
- [ ] **Migration Scripts**: Database migrations work correctly (if applicable)
- [ ] **Rollback Plan**: Clear rollback strategy exists

### Git Commit Process

Once ALL safety checks pass:

#### 1. Stage and Commit Changes
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with detailed message
git commit -m "feat(step-[N]): [STEP_TITLE]

[Detailed description of what was implemented]

âœ… Safety Checks Completed:
- All tests pass ([X] unit, [X] integration)
- Code quality checks pass
- Security scan clean
- Documentation updated
- Performance impact assessed

Implements: [Step requirements summary]
Testing: [Testing approach summary]
"
```

#### 2. Push Branch
```bash
# Push the feature branch
git push origin feature/step-[N]-[short-description]
```

### Final Step Report

After completing all implementation and safety checks, provide this report:

```
# Step [N] Completion Report

## âœ… Implementation Summary
- **Step Title**: [STEP_TITLE]
- **Branch**: feature/step-[N]-[short-description]
- **Commit Hash**: [COMMIT_HASH]
- **Files Modified**: [LIST_OF_FILES]
- **Lines Added**: [NUMBER]
- **Lines Removed**: [NUMBER]

## âœ… Safety Checks Results
- **All Tests Pass**: âœ… ([X] unit tests, [X] integration tests)
- **Code Quality**: âœ… (linting, formatting, type checking)
- **Security Scan**: âœ… (no vulnerabilities found)
- **Performance Impact**: âœ… (no degradation detected)
- **Documentation**: âœ… (all docs updated)

## âœ… Next Steps
- **Ready for Review**: The implementation is complete and ready for code review
- **Manual Testing**: Consider additional manual testing if needed
- **Next Step**: Proceed to Step [N+1] after confirmation

## ðŸ›‘ STOPPING FOR HUMAN CONFIRMATION
This step is complete and all safety checks have passed. Please review the implementation and confirm before proceeding to the next step.

**To continue**: Confirm you're ready for Step [N+1]
**To modify**: Provide feedback for adjustments to this step
**To pause**: Work can be resumed later from this point
```
