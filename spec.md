# Tic Tac Toe Game Specification

## Project Overview
**Project Name:** Vue.js Tic Tac Toe Game
**Purpose:** Learning project to practice web development skills, specifically Vue.js
**Target Users:** Developer (learning Vue.js concepts)
**Primary Goal:** Build a functional tic tac toe game with AI opponent using Vue.js

### Success Metrics
- Functional game with human vs human and human vs AI modes
- Clean, minimal UI with smooth interactions
- Proper Vue.js component structure and state management
- Deployable to GitHub Pages as portfolio piece

## Functional Requirements

### Core Game Features
- **Game Board:** 3x3 grid for tic tac toe
- **Player Modes:**
  - Human vs Human (same device)
  - Human vs AI (3 difficulty levels)
- **Game Flow:** X always goes first
- **Win Detection:** Highlight winning line when game ends
- **Game Reset:** New game functionality

### AI Opponent
- **Easy:** Random valid moves
- **Medium:** Mix of random and basic strategy (block obvious wins)
- **Hard:** Better strategic moves (block + try to win)
- **Response:** Instant AI moves (no delay)

### User Interface
- **Design:** Clean, minimal aesthetic
- **Interactions:** Simple click-to-place pieces
- **Visual Feedback:** Winning line highlights
- **Platform:** Desktop-focused (no mobile optimization required)

## Technical Requirements

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend Framework:** Vue.js 3 (Composition API recommended for learning)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Build Tool:** Vite (for fast development and modern tooling)
- **Browser Support:** Modern browsers only (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

### Architecture Overview
```

├── components/
│   ├── GameBoard.vue (main game container)
│   ├── GameCell.vue (individual cell)
│   ├── GameStatus.vue (current player, winner display)
│   └── DifficultySelector.vue (AI difficulty chooser)
├── composables/
│   ├── useGameLogic.js (game state management)
│   └── useAI.js (AI move generation)
├── App.vue (root component)
└── main.js (Vue app initialization)
```

### Performance Requirements
- Instant response to user clicks
- Smooth visual transitions (< 300ms)
- Minimal bundle size for fast loading

## Data Requirements

### Game State Model
```javascript
{
  board: Array(9), // ['X', 'O', null, ...]
  currentPlayer: 'X' | 'O',
  gameMode: 'human' | 'ai',
  aiDifficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard',
  winner: 'X' | 'O' | 'tie' | null,
  winningLine: Array<number> | null,
  isGameActive: boolean
}
```

### Data Flow
1. User clicks cell → Update board state
2. Check for win/tie conditions
3. Switch player (or trigger AI move)
4. AI calculates move based on difficulty
5. Update UI with new state

## User Interface Requirements

### Component Structure
- **App.vue:** Root container, game mode selection
- **GameBoard.vue:** 3x3 grid, handles clicks, displays current state
- **GameCell.vue:** Individual cell component with hover states
- **GameStatus.vue:** Displays current player, winner, new game button
- **DifficultySelector.vue:** AI difficulty selection

### Visual Design (Tailwind Classes)
- **Board:** Clean grid with subtle borders
- **Cells:** Large clickable areas with hover effects
- **Players:** Distinct X and O styling
- **Winner:** Highlighted winning line with color emphasis
- **Colors:** Minimal palette (grays, single accent color)

### Accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Tab through interactive elements
- **Screen Reader:** Proper ARIA labels for game state
- **Visual Indicators:** Clear visual feedback for all actions

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] Human vs Human mode works correctly
- [ ] All AI difficulties make valid moves
- [ ] Win detection works for all 8 possible lines
- [ ] Tie games detected properly
- [ ] New game resets all state
- [ ] UI updates correctly after each move
- [ ] Game prevents moves on occupied cells
- [ ] Game prevents moves after game ends

### AI Testing
- [ ] Easy AI makes random valid moves
- [ ] Medium AI blocks obvious wins sometimes
- [ ] Hard AI plays strategically
- [ ] AI never makes invalid moves

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: MVP (Target: 10 minutes)
1. **Setup:** Vite + Vue 3 + Tailwind project
2. **Basic Board:** 3x3 grid with click handlers
3. **Game Logic:** Win detection, player switching
4. **Simple AI:** Random move AI only
5. **Basic UI:** Minimal styling, winner display

### Phase 2: Enhancement (If time permits)
1. **AI Improvements:** Medium and Hard difficulties
2. **Visual Polish:** Animations, better styling
3. **Game Features:** Mode selection, difficulty picker

### Phase 3: Deployment
1. **Build Optimization:** Production build
2. **GitHub Pages:** Deploy to GitHub Pages
3. **Documentation:** README with live demo link

## Deployment and Operations

### Build Process
```bash
npm run build  # Creates dist/ folder for deployment
```

### GitHub Deployment
- **Repository:** Public GitHub repository
- **Pages:** Deploy dist/ folder to GitHub Pages
- **Domain:** username.github.io/tic-tac-toe-vue

### File Structure for GitHub
```

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Vue.js Learning Curve:** Mitigate with simple component structure
- **Time Constraint:** Focus on MVP first, enhance later
- **AI Complexity:** Start with random AI, improve incrementally

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development:** Build working version first
- **Simple State Management:** Use Vue's built-in reactivity
- **Fallback Plans:** If AI is complex, ship with human vs human only

## Quick Start Commands
```bash
npm create vue@latest tic-tac-toe-vue
cd tic-tac-toe-vue
npm install
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
npm run dev
```

This specification prioritizes getting a working game quickly while providing a clear path for enhancements. Start with Phase 1 for your 10-minute goal, then iterate based on your learning interests!
